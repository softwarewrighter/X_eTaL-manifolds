# The library search path, XETAL_PATH (docs/plan.md, G2): this
# repository's libs/*/src, then X_eTaL-ML's at the pin, then every
# library of X_eTaL-libraries at this repository's own pin (so Matrix
# is found, though X_eTaL-ML links only those it uses). PREFIX is put
# before each path, which is otherwise relative to the repository's
# root: "../../" from a demo's directory, so baselines and messages do
# not depend on where the repository is checked out; none gives
# absolute paths. Adapted from X_eTaL-fine-tuning's scripts/libpath.sh
# (unchanged but for this comment; docs/xetal-ML-asks.md, GM2).
