# Run with scripts/py (the uv venv .venv), never a system python.
"""Test one demo's built page in a real browser (scripts/browser-check.sh).

Headless Chrome loads pages/<slug>/ (scripts/browser-dom.sh), whose
WebAssembly runs the demo's .xtl with the pinned X_eTaL; the rendered
page must then show no X_eTaL error, be framed (a section for each of
the question, the background, the rationale, the purpose, the summary
and what is next, each marked data-frame, so no page jumps into its
subject), show every line of demos/<slug>/web/browser.txt (text the
page only shows once X_eTaL has run), and have every link from its
code into the cross-reference land on a real entry.

browser.txt: a line is text the page's <main> must show; a line
starting "html: " is a piece of the rendered document itself (an
element that only exists once something has happened); "#" starts a
comment. A line "@ ?stage=3&rank=5" starts a section checked on the
page opened at that address (its query string), so states a reader reaches
by clicking are checked too, not only the page as first loaded.

Prints one line per check, the same each run, so reg-rs can keep it as
a baseline (browser-<slug> in the demo's reg/).
